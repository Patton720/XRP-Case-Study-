# Ripple Labs A Case Study
## Overview and Origin

Ripple Labs was originally called Open Coin and was "founded in September of 2012 by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb." [^1]"It wasnt until 2015 that the company re-named themselves "Ripple Labs"." [^2]
 The idea for Ripple/XRP came about through two ideas really. One idea was from a man named Ryan Fugger. Fugger's idea was "to create a monetary sytem that was not only decentralized but that would also give individuals the power to make their own money. This sytem later became known as *Ripple Pay*. The second idea was that of Jed McCaleb. McCaleb wanted to create a way where digital currency transactions would be variffied by members of a network through a consensus rather than a mining process utilized by Bitcoin." [^3] McCaleb eventually teamed up with Chris Larsen where they ended up speaking with Fugger and conviencing him to partner up with them. With the two ideas finally together so was born *Open Coin*


    Ripple initially recieved funding through "angel investers with two rounds of angel funding followed by a round of seed and then a round of each Series A & B."^4 So, it would have looked something like this:

* Angel rounds- 5.5 million
* Seed round-   3.5 million
* Series A (1&2)- 32 million
* Series B-     55 Million

Ripple Labs raised a total of 96 million dollars. Ripple Labs funding continues through the selling of their Currency, XRP. 

## Business Activities
 Ripple Labs is working to "enable faster, lower-cost payments around world"^5
The intended clients for Ripple are companies with large money transactions and the need to make global transactions. 
 "Currently the market size for transactional value in digital remittances is around $79,327M and is expected to show an annual growth rate of 15.9% by 2023 with an amount of $143,096M"^6
  What Ripple offers that it's competitors do not is a Centrialized cryptocurrency. Along with their XRP being centrialized their ledger is among the fastest to be varifed "with around 1500 transactions per second and closing of new ledgers every 4 seconds."^7 Lets compare that to Bitcoin which takes "several minutes to close a ledger and can only process around 10 transactions a second."^8 The Unfair advantage that Ripple offers is a centralized blockchain. This makes it much more approachable by the likes of centrialized entities such as Banks and governments.

 Ripple's current technology would be Ripple Net. "RippleNet makes it easy for its diverse network of 300+ financial institutions worldwide to enable faster, lower-cost payments around the world."^9 How it works is "With a single connection, access the best blockchain technology for global payments, payout capabilities in 40+ currencies, On-Demand Liquidity as an alternative to pre-funding, and operational consistency through a common rulebook."^10

## Landscape

## Recommendations

 If I were to suggest a product or service to Ripple Labs it would most likely be a money tranference app such as Venmo or Zelle as well as a money transference system like that of Western Union. However, to create something like Western Union would be the same as one of the companies they are currently partnered with, Money Gram, so I can see how that would be a conflict of interest.
Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? I believe that utilizing a payment app would help put XRP in the hands of everyday people with real world applications. It would work best for those who already have accounts with the banks that are currently partnered with Ripple Labs (American Express, Santander,etc.) By putting the app/coin in your average users pocket you would be not only be capturing a bank to bank transfering market but also peer to peer. This would allow other potenital clients, Big banks, see the use and functionality of their product and allow them to gain more customers. This could then also lead them to becoming a banking intity of their own as well, putting XRP ahead of the game as far as becoming an actual daily usable cryptocurrency.
What tech. would this additional product or service utilize? The tech involved would of course be a mobil app in which peers could transfer money Using XRP and/ or Ripple's blockchain ledger. A secondary tech could simply be a debit/credit card which also utilizes XRP. These techs are appropriate for this solution as it would allow XRP/Ripple to scale faster and show potential clients real time scaliblity.
