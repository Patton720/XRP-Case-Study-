# Ripple Labs A Case Study
## Overview and Origin

Ripple Labs was originally called Open Coin and was founded in September of 2012 by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb. It wasnt until 2015 that the company re-named themselves "Ripple Labs".
 The idea for Ripple/XRP came about through two ideas really. One idea was from a man named Ryan Fugger. Fugger's idea was to create a monetary sytem that was not only decentralized but that would also give individuals the power to make their own money. This sytem later became known as *Ripple Pay*. The second idea was that of Jed McCaleb. McCaleb wanted to "create a way where digital currency transactions would be variffied by members of a network through a consensus rather than a mining process utilized by Bitcoin." ^wikipedia McCaleb eventually teamed up with Chris Larsen where they ended up speaking with Fugger and conviencing him to partner up with them. With the two ideas finally together so was born *Open Coin*


    Ripple initially recieved funding through angel investers with two rounds of angel funding followed by a round of seed and then a round of each Series A & B. So, it would have looked something like this:

* Angel rounds- 5.5 million
* Seed round-   3.5 million
* Series A (1&2)- 32 million
* Series B-     55 Million

Ripple Labs raised a total of 96 million dollars. Ripple Labs funding continues through the selling of their Currency, XRP.

What soultion does this company offer that their competitors do not/cannot offer? (what is the unfair advantage? What Ripple offers that it's competitors do not is a Centrialized cryptocurrency. Along with their XRP being centrialized their ledger is among the fastest to be varifed with around 1500 transactions per second and closing of new ledgers every 4 seconds. Lets compare that to Bitcoin which takes minutes to close a ledger and can only process around 27 transactions a second. The Unfair advantage that Ripple offers is a centralized blockchain. This makes it much more approachable by the likes of centrialized entities such as Banks and governments.
